# FeedForwardNeuralNetwork

This repository contains code for Feed Forward Neural Network with 1 hidden layer written from scratch

* The implemented Neural Network was then used for classifying circles dataset. It is a small dataset, but is chosen for testing the implementation as it is not linearly separable.

* The same implementation was then used on CIFAR-10 dataset to distinguish between two classes(cats and deers)

* The existing Neural Network was further improved by:
  * Implementing regularization 
  * Adding an additional hidden layer
